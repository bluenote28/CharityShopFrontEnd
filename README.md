# Ebay Charity Shop

This is a site that is essentially a wrapper for ebay that helps you locate items that benefit charity.

Site is currently hosted at: https://charityshopusa.com

The backend code is written in Python using the Django Framework. The repo for that is here: https://github.com/bluenote28/CharityShopBackend

# Features

The site has an administration page that can only be viewed by users with an adminstrator account. From this page, you can see which charities are already in the database, add a new charity to the database, and view statistics of what is in the database.

Once a new charity is entered in the form pictured above, the backend will automatically load items from ebay into the database.
